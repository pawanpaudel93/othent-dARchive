## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

dARchive is a decentralized archiving application that lets you snapshot any webpage anytime to create a digital archive so you can access it forever. It uses different web3 technologies to provide the decentralized version of the archiving application called archive.today

It allows a user to save a webpage HTML and screenshot to the decentralized storage called Arweave. The user can search the stored webpages based on different filters and can view and download the saved webpages and screenshots. This can be useful if you want to take a 'snapshot' of a page that could change soon: price list, job offer, real estate listing, drunk blog post, etc.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Archive: User connects a wallet to the dApp then visit the archive page and enter a URL to archive. Then, the html and screenshot of the webpage is saved and uploaded via Othent to Arweave to store it permanently.

2. My Archives: User can see their archived webpages and screenshots and also can download them.

3. Search: User can query with filters to get the search results and view the saved webpages and screenshots and also can download them.
