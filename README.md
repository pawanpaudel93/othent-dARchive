## üßê About

**dARchive** is a decentralized archiving app that lets you snapshot any webpage anytime to create a digital archive and save it to **[Arweave](https://arweave.org/ "Arweave")** using **[Othent](https://othent.io/ "Othent")** so that you can access it forever.

It allows a user to save a webpage HTML and screenshot to the decentralized storage called Arweave. The user can search the stored webpages and can view and download the saved webpages and screenshots. This can be useful if you want to take a 'snapshot' of a page that could change soon: price list, job offer, real estate listing, drunk blog post, etc.

## üéà Usage

1. **Archive**: Users can sign in using their Gmail account, visit the archive page, and enter a URL to create an archive. Then, the html and screenshot of the webpage is uploaded via Othent to Arweave to store it permanently.

2. **My Archives**: Users can view their archived webpages and screenshots.

3. **Search**: Users can search using a URL to retrieve the search results. They can view the saved webpages and screenshots.
